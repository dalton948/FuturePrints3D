Future Prints 3D
-----------------------

Basic website for an idea based around 3D printing just to give it substance. Built the project with the mind set of Mobile First with 2 media queries adjusting content area
sizes. 

CSS included features: FlexBox to adjust single columns to two-columns and a CSS animation on the title to glow when the page size is 1024px +
JavaScript Features: Functional Form that validates each entry with the text turning red if not filled out appropiately. It will also send an alert stating if 
you have entered in something incorrectly or say Welcome with your name when it has been entered correctly. Tossed in a slide show just because.
